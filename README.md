some of my work is as shown above. but here in this github place i do much more then art. i am keenly interested in intellegent systems and wisdom based systems coding for creative use and designing extensions to the human expiernce to allow better productivity. 

in other things i also have a keen intrest in video games both technically and design, with again a focus on intellegnt systems 

as with most of my projects they are done in iterations seprated from one another then brought together to interect as modules. forcing a modulor design and resuability within each iteration. though i have yet to finish a many of them, i do have a number of working prototypes and programs that i use to further reaserch and design on the next iterations.

I'am curretly learning deep learning techniques and the pipline from maths to prototype training and deployment of custom models.

I'am also currently engaged in learning netowrking for games among other game related aspects.
